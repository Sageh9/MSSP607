        "**Insights and Recommendations**\n",
        "\n",
        "The analysis reveals significant relationships between academic performance (measured by percentile) and several socioeconomic and demographic factors.\n",
        "\n",
        "1.  **Parental education significantly influences outcomes.** As shown by the \"Average Percentile by Father's Education\" output and the ANOVA p-value of 0.000, there are significant differences in academic performance across different levels of father's education. Students whose fathers have postgraduate education have the highest average percentile (82.42), while those with fathers having only complete primary education or no education tend to have lower percentiles (around 60-62). This suggests a positive correlation between higher parental education and better academic performance.\n",
        "\n",
        "2.  **Socioeconomic stratum significantly impacts performance, and there are clear differences between strata.** The \"Average Percentile by Stratum\" output and the ANOVA p-value of 0.000 demonstrate significant differences in performance across strata. Stratum 6 performs best with an average percentile of 85.83, followed closely by Stratum 5 (83.20). Performance generally decreases as the stratum level decreases, with Stratum 1 and Stratum 0 showing the lowest average percentiles (56.97 and 58.86 respectively). This indicates a strong positive correlation between higher socioeconomic stratum and better academic performance.\n",
        "\n",
        "3.  **How does each gender perform in the global assessment?** There is a statistically significant difference in global assessment performance between genders. The t-test result (t=4.685, p=0.000) indicates that this difference is statistically significant. Male students, with an average percentile of 69.35, outperform female students, who have an average percentile of 67.13.\n",
        "\n",
        "4.  **Use your analysis to understand the results. What did you find interesting, and can you make any recommendations or inferences?**\n",
        "    My analysis reinforces the strong influence of socioeconomic factors and parental education on academic performance. The significant difference in performance across strata and the correlation with parental education are particularly interesting findings, highlighting potential inequalities in educational opportunities or support. While the gender difference is statistically significant, the magnitude of the difference in mean percentiles is smaller compared to the differences observed across educational levels and strata.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Recommendations:**\n",
        "\n",
        "*   **Targeted Support for Lower Strata:** Implement programs and provide resources specifically designed to support students from lower socioeconomic strata to help bridge the performance gap.\n",
        "*   **Promote Parental Engagement:** Develop initiatives to encourage parental involvement in education, particularly for parents with lower levels of formal education, emphasizing the positive impact it can have on their children's academic success.\n",
        "*   **Investigate Gender Differences:** Conduct further research to understand the underlying reasons for the observed gender difference in performance to develop targeted interventions if necessary."
